# Quick Overview

## Description

The new Overview makes use of some improvements to the Badges in Home Assistant. It uses the visibility function to show and hide the Badges depending on their state. It also make adjustments depending on the screen width to some elements. 
No need to switch between Mobile (portrait) and Desktop (landscape) Mode anymore :-)
